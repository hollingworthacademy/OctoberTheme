<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>We at Hollingworth are passionate in actively promoting and encouraging a strong reading ethos in school. Each pupil is required to have in their possession a reading book as part of their everyday equipment.</p>

<p>According to research carried out by the Centre for Research in Psychology, Behaviour and Achievement at Coventry University:</p>

<blockquote>Reading for pleasure has been associated not only with increases in reading attainment but also with writing ability, text comprehension, grammar, breadth of vocabulary, attitudes, self-confidence as a reader, pleasure in reading in later life, general knowledge, a better understanding of other cultures, community participation, a greater insight into human nature and decision-making.</blockquote>

<h2>LRC and Resources</h2>

<h3>Fiction Section</h3>

<p>In order to encourage literacy, the LRC is stocked with a wide range of resources accessible to all pupils regardless of ability. Stock is replenished on an annual basis and pupils are encouraged to suggest books or favourite authors that will be purchased on their behalf. It is vital that up to date stock is available on the shelves in order to maintain a good reading ethos in school.</p>

<p>We have recently undertaken a stock take of the fiction section of the library and have taken the opportunity of re-arranging the shelves in much the same way as the high street bookshops, making the library easier to navigate. Every effort is made to ensure that pupils are reading materials which are age appropriate. We have therefore taken the liberty of introducing three main sections within the fiction section of the library:</p>

<h4>Young Reader Section</h4>

<p>This section is for pupils between the age of 11-12 and stocks a host of popular titles and authors.</p>

<h4>Young Teen Section</h4>

<p>This section is for pupils between the age of 12+ - 14 and the resources are colour coded with an orange sticker.</p>

<h4>Young Adult Section</h4>

<p>This section is for pupils 14+ and over and the resources are colour coded with a red sticker.</p>

<p>Should younger pupils wish to choose books from the Young Teen section, they are advised to bring a note from their parent, giving their permission for their child to read these resources.</p>

<h4>Graphic Novels</h4>

<p>We have an extensive range of graphic novels located in the LRC and these can be loaned out in the usual way.</p>

<h4>Magazines</h4>

<p>We have a selection of educational magazines and comics which are available to pupils in the LRC. Magazines are to be read in the LRC only and are not to be taken home.</p>

<p>Books are loaned over a two weeks period and pupils are advised that whilst the book is in their care, they are responsible for the book and that it should be returned in good condition. All resources are issued with a plastic jacket and pupils are provided with a plastic wallet in which to keep the book to protect from damage. Any books returned damaged or lost items, must be paid for and this can be done via Wisepay.</p>

<h3>Non-Fiction Section</h3>

<p>There is a wide range of resources supporting each subject area available in the LRC. Pupils should be utilising this resource as well as internet based resources for their research and completing homework.</p>

<h3>Careers Library</h3>

<p>Hollingworth achieved the Gold Inspiring IAG award in October 2015. This is in recognition of the careers provision in school.</p>

<p>In order to maintain this status, regular audits of the Careers Library is undertaken to ensure that the information provided is accurate and up to date.</p>
