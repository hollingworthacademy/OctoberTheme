<p>The Mathematics Department is made up of twelve dedicated and enthusiastic teachers and supported by two experienced and well established Learning Progress Assistants. The Head of Department leads the department with invaluable support from three Assistant Heads of Mathematics and an Assistant Headteacher. All teachers in the department follow a detailed scheme of work which is regularly updated to meet the demands of the new curriculum. Through the hard work of both our teachers and our pupils, the success of the department continues to grow with 86% of pupils achieving grade 4 or higher in their GCSE Mathematics examinations in 2018. In addition to this, 73% achieved a grade 5 or above and 27% a grade 7 or above. The Mathematics Department is passionate about producing well-rounded mathematicians and see the characteristics of resilience and independence as being just as important as exam success. To support this ethos, the department regularly runs trips and enrichment opportunities, such as UKMT challenges and trips to universities, and continue to explore further opportunities to engage pupils in Mathematics. The department is made up of:</p>

<h2>The Curriculum</h2>

<h3>Key Stage 3</h3>

<p>Pupils in Years 7 &amp; 8 receive three 60 minute lessons per week, and pupils in Year 9 receive four 60 minute lessons per week. All year groups receive homework each week, as is the policy at Hollingworth. Pupils are taught in set groups and progress is tracked and monitored by an Assistant Head of Mathematics to provide additional support and intervention. All groups are given a pre-test at the beginning of each half term to assess prior knowledge which ensures lessons are delivered at a level that is challenging for the pupils. At the end of each half term pupils are given a post-test on the content they have covered that half term which will shows how much progress they have made. All year groups in key stage 3 are given a summative test at the end of the school year to gauge their progress over the whole year.</p>

<h3>Key Stage 4</h3>

<p>Pupils in Years 10 &amp; 11 receive four 60 minute lessons a week with homework set once or twice a week. Pupils are currently preparing for the new two year GCSE course to be taken with the Edexcel examination board (100% examinations). Pupils are taught in set groups and progress is tracked and monitored by the Head of Mathematics to provide additional support and intervention. As with key stage 3 all groups are given a pre-test at the beginning of each half term to assess prior knowledge which ensure lessons are delivered at a level that is challenging for the pupils. At the end of each half term pupils are given a post-test on the content they have covered that half term which shows how much progress they have made. Year 10 and 11 pupils will complete 3 summative assessments per year in the form of mock examinations in order to identify topics for improvement.</p>
