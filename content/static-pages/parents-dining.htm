<p>From September 2013 the school has invested in its dining provision for all children. This was the result of a two year review carried out by the school and external consultancies, which included visits to other <em>World Class</em><span>&nbsp;</span>school dining provisions across Britain. The aims of Hollingworth's dining facility are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Healthy balanced diet</li>
	<li>Increased menu choice</li>
	<li>World cuisine â€“ Experience a range of different food and flavours</li>
	<li>Use of quality, fresh and local produce</li>
	<li>All food made from scratch by well trained staff</li>
	<li>Presented at restaurant standards</li>
</ul>

<p>To support these aims we have appointed an experienced chef (September 2013) to the catering team whose responsibility is the food production. They are working closely with the existing team to embed our aims throughout the full service.</p>

<h2>Meet the Chef</h2>

<p>Chef has 20+ years' experience in catering and has worked in 4 &amp; 5 star hotels across Britain in chef roles. He has experience of creating menus, producing high quality dishes and developing kitchens for various types of mass catering. He believes in using the best, fresh and where possible local produce to enhance his food and delivering this to your child at restaurant standards. His aim, is to provide your child with a balanced diet throughout their school day which will include their <em>Main Meal</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the day, to hopefully support your busy home life in the evenings.</p>
