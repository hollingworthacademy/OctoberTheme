<h2>Our Vision for 'World Class' Schooling</h2>

<p>Our Vision for 'World Class' Schooling is one in which all pupils:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Make outstanding progress in their learning, regardless of ability, gender, social background or ethnic origin.</li>
	<li>Are engaged in a curriculum suffused with memorable experiences and rich in opportunities for learning.</li>
	<li>Learn, with teachers, in an environment which is mutually respectful and promotes a shared enjoyment of learning.</li>
	<li>Develop social attitudes and behaviours founded upon the values of respect, responsibility, and resilience.</li>
	<li>Develop the transferable skills and attitudes necessary to thrive in the global economy of the 21st Century.</li>
</ul>

<p>We believe that we will achieve this through a commitment to the principlesof Excellence, Equity, Engagement, and Enterprise. The pages which follow define these principles, illustrate how they inform school improvement measures and provide a framework to understand progress made towards becoming a 'World Class' School.</p>

		<h2>Excellence</h2>

		<p>Excellence is both an expectation for the quality of all provision and practice across the school as well as a specific commitment to ensure that our pupils make excellent academic progress.</p>

		<p>When considering future school improvement stratergies for Hollingworth Academy, two key questions need to be asked:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>What would 'World Class' outcomes for our pupils look like?</li>
			<li>Does the proposed action achieve this or serve to move us towards this position?</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The principle of 'Excellence' is applied to school and departmental action plans through stratergies aimed at raising standards of both key stages.</p>

		<h2>Equity</h2>

		<p>Our aim is to ensure that all school processes and actions result in all pupils having access to an outstanding experience of education while making 'World Class' progress, regardless of ability, gender, social background or ethnic origin. In achieving this it is essential that Hollingworth Academy deals with all stakehodlers in a fair, transparent and appropriate manner.</p>

		<p>Fundamentally, the notion of equity in education is concerned with reducing and ultimately eliminating underachievement and the removal of the barriers to each pupils' learning and success.</p>

		<p>The principle of 'Equity' can be applied to school and departmental action plans through stratergies which aim to; close attainment gaps; remove barriers to learning; personalise provision and improve literacy skills.</p>

		<h2>Engagement</h2>

		<p>Our aim is to develop a culture in which pupils, staff, governors and other stakehodlers actively participate in learning and the life of the school.</p>

		<p>Through this the learning community of Hollingworth Academy will be strengthened and we will enrich our curriculum by developing partnerships with others on a local, regional, national and global basis.</p>

		<p>Thr principle of 'Engagement' can be applied to school and departmental action plans through stratergies which aim to develop the curriculum; improve the attendance, punctuality and behaviour of pupils; improve the learning environment; reduce exclusions; develop the impact of pupil and stakeholder voice; further engage parents and develop links with outside agencies.</p>

		<h2>Enterprise</h2>

		<p>Enterprise is concerned with building capacity - for the learner, the teacher, the leader and the school. This will enable us:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>To promote a culture of personal and collective enterprise.</li>
			<li>To develop distributed leadership and a culture of disciplined innovation.</li>
			<li>To develop the personal, learning and enterprise skills of all pupils.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The principle of 'Enterprise' can be applied to school and departmental action plans through stratergies which aim to; improve the quality of teaching; develop the learning capacity of pupils and improve the impact of leadership and management.</p>
