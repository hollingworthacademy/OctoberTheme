<p>The Drama and Dance Department benefit from being housed in state of the art accommodation, which is comprised of three separate studios that can be collapsed into one large performance space. Each studio is equipped with sound and theatre lighting systems and Interactive Whiteboards. Each room also has a suite of laptops which are accessible to pupils both within lessons and after school, to assist with independent learning and homework.</p>

<h2>The Curriculum</h2>

<h3>Key Stage 3</h3>

<h4>Drama</h4>

<p>Year 7 drama lessons are used to establish ground rules, to build a positive working atmosphere in which pupils exhibit good self-control and mutual trust, and to have the confidence to take risks with ideas and in performance. Pupils develop the habit of reflection and evaluation and are taught to use a variety of dramatic techniques to explore ideas, issues, texts and meanings. They use different ways to convey action, character, atmosphere and tension when they are devising and performing in plays, through voice, language, movement, technique and stage positioning. The year 8 drama curriculum builds on the work in year 7 by aiming to develop the studentsâ€™ dramatic eyesight in relation to character, atmosphere and structure. They increase their understanding of form and style, including the use of abstract techniques and physical theatre. They begin to experiment with theatre technology. In year 9 they begin to work with an increasing sophistication as groundwork for the transition to KS4, and encounter more challenging themes and performance situations.</p>

<h4>Dance</h4>

<p>In Dance, pupils are required to demonstrate ways in which performed dance works are constructed. They will also use choreographic devices and learn how other art forms can be integrated with performed dance, to complement and enhance expression. A range of performance styles are studied which increase the pupils' knowledge, skill and understanding of accuracy, control, spatial awareness, composition and communication through performance. As they progress through Key Stage 3 the pupils will be challenged to function in more sophisticated ways.</p>

<h3>Key Stage 4</h3>

<p>Pupils in years 10 and 11 receive three 1 hour lessons per week and follow the Pearson BTEC Tech Award in Performing Arts.
