</dl>

<p>The department is well organised, enthusiastic and committed to the teaching of Design and Technology and understand that it is a unique subject that requires and promotes the combined use of practical and academic skills in a wide range of differing media.</p>

<p>The Design and Technology rooms are each fitted with state of the art facilities including Interactive Whiteboards and Visualisers. The department currently consists of three specialised teaching rooms including two well-equipped workshops, one being a specialist engineering workshop and the other a specialist product design workshop. The third, an electronics and CAD (Computer Aided Design) classroom, consists of a suite of high specification computers and a variety of educational software, including Techsoft 2D Design, Solidworks and yenka. In addition to the teaching rooms, the Design and Technology Department also has a state of the art CAD/CAM (Computer Aided Manufacture) room which consists of a number of CNC machines including laser cutters, Camm cutter and plotter, 3D Router and 3D Printer.</p>

<h2>The Curriculum</h2>

<h3>Key Stage 3</h3>

<p>Pupils in Years 7, 8 &amp; 9 receive one 60 minute lesson a week with homework set once every two weeks, as is the policy at Hollingworth. Pupils are taught in mixed ability groups with class sizes of 25 students or fewer. Progress is tracked and monitored in accordance with agreed procedure. Pupils complete a baseline assessment on entry in Year 7 and will receive between three and four National Curriculum assessments a year.</p>

<p>The subject is studied by all Year 7 and 8 pupils, and focuses on the teaching of electronics, CAD/CAM, graphics, resistant materials, structures, mechanisms and control technology. Pupil can opt out to study Materials Technology or STEM as part of our Preference Curriculum in Year 9.</p>

<p>Projects and activities are designed to stimulate pupil imagination and interest to the point when, in Year 9. The experience gained during curriculum time provides a foundation from which the subject can be studied as an option for GCSE. Key Stage 3 allows for the full breadth of projects to be produced, from hands on practical work to machine-based production, including CAD/CAM.</p>

<h3>Key Stage 4</h3>

<p>In Key Stage 4, the department offers AQA Design and Technology as a GCSE course BTec Engineering level 2 and construction.</p>

<p>Pupils in Years 10 &amp; 11 receive three one hour lessons a week with homework set once or twice a week. The two year GCSE course in Design and Technology follows the AQA examination board, (50% examinations and 50% controlled assessment). Pupils are taught in mixed groups and progress is tracked and monitored in accordance with agreed procedure. Pupils complete a range of both formal and informal assessments in the form of extended writing activities in class, as well as mock and real examinations.</p>

<h2>Extended Curriculum</h2>

<h3>After School Clubs</h3>

<p>The department offers a range of extra-curricular activities, including a weekly Lego Club, where pupils have the opportunity to compete in regional and national competitions and STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) challenges. At Key Stage 4, pupils have the opportunity to attend after school catch-up sessions. Competitions, both in school, regional and national are entered regularly.</p>
