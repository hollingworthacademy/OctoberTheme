<p>On entering the school each pupil is placed in a mixed-ability tutor group, which is carefully constructed to take into consideration issues such as friendship patterns and backgrounds.</p>

<p>The tutor is the member of staff who will be in closest regular contact with your child. &nbsp;The tutor sees your child daily and needs to be aware of any problem affecting attendance, behaviour, homework or progress. &nbsp; Your child's tutor may contact you should problems arise.</p>

<p>Each year group has a Head of Year who has oversight of all pupils and works closely with your child's tutor. &nbsp;They can be contacted at school if you have any queries or if problems arise.</p>

<p>Heads of Year are sometimes available to take telephone calls during the day. &nbsp;However, the school office will take messages throughout the day and pass information on to the Head of Year.</p>

<p>The Heads of Year are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mrs L Aubin (Year 7)</li>
	<li>Mrs L Armitage (Year 8)</li>
	<li>Mrs M Hartley (Year 9)</li>
	<li>Mr M Farrell (Year 10)</li>
	<li>Mr M Hollis (Year 11)</li>
</ul>

<p>Working closely with the Heads of Year is Mr M Morrell (Acting Deputy Headteacher) who is also available to speak to with respect to pastoral matters. &nbsp;In addition, Mrs J Brown is the school Inclusion Manager and is in charge of transition. &nbsp;Working closely with Mrs Brown is Mrs C Edmends who is the Transition Mentor.</p>

<p>The Headteacher, Mr D Randle, and Deputy Headteachers, Mr S White and Mr M Kojder, may also be contacted should the need arise.</p>

<p>If you wish to come into school to speak to a member of staff it is essential to telephone first to make an appointment. &nbsp;If this is not possible, then every attempt will be made to organise an interview with a member of the senior staff, although this may involve a waiting period.</p>

<h2>Pupils' Responsibilities and Discipline</h2>

<p>It is our aim to produce a well-ordered, hard-working and caring community where pupils are valued as individuals and treated as young adults.</p>

<p>School Leaders are appointed each year and these pupils will be expected to share in the responsibilities associated with the day to day running of the school.</p>

<p>Pupils are elected to serve on Year Councils and School Councils.</p>

<h2>The Aim of Our School Council Is:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>To provide a method of encouraging pupils, irrespective of their gender, ability, background, or ethnicity to become actively involved in decisions about their own learning and empowering them with appropriate ways to do so.</li>
	<li>To ensure that the learners themselves are involved in decisions about how, what and when they learn and the type of environment in which this occurs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pupil Behaviour</h2>

<p>We expect high standards of behaviour from all pupils and we try very hard to make sure that discipline is based on firmness and fairness. &nbsp;Good behaviour, work and attendance are rewarded through the School Referral System, Vivo Miles and school rewards trips. &nbsp;This aims to recognise and reward those pupils who have a positive attitude to learning. &nbsp;Pupils who fail to follow the requirements of the Code of Conduct will be challenged and sanctions will be used to help address the issues. &nbsp;We expect your support for school sanctions because we know that by working together we are able to achieve the best for your child.</p>

<p>When it is decided that a detention is appropriate, parents/carers will be given notice in advance that their child is being detained. &nbsp;It is the pupil's responsibility to inform you of their detention as it is not possible to telephone every parent/carer. &nbsp;All parents/carers should be aware that the school has a strict policy concerning after school detentions. &nbsp;If it is necessary to detain pupils after school, parents/carers should note that these sessions are <strong>COMPULSORY</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and play an integral part of school discipline.</p>

<p>Finally, we will not tolerate bullying, violence, threats of violence, bad language, insolence or abuse. &nbsp;Any of these could lead to a pupil being isolated, internally excluded in school or further more serious sanctions.<strong><br></strong></p>

<h2>Attendance</h2>

<p>Absence from school for part or all of a day can be permitted only for personal illness or a medical appointment. &nbsp;We would encourage parents/carers to avoid arranging medical and similar appointments during school hours.</p>

<p>Full attendance is required at all lessons and pupils will be expected to copy up any work that is missed. &nbsp;To ensure that the school can fulfil its role in the education of all pupils, parents/carers are asked to contact school by telephone or a note on the first day of any absence.</p>

<p>The pupil on their <strong>RETURN</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>to school <strong>MUST</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>bring in a note giving reasons for and the exact dates of the absence. &nbsp;In all cases the full absence must be covered by a note, which should be given to the tutor. &nbsp;It is the parent's/carer's responsibility to inform the school of any absence. &nbsp;The school also operates a computerised telephone system that automatically contacts parents/carers if pupils are absent from school.</p>

<p>An appointment card or letter must be produced beforehand to cover dental or medical treatment. &nbsp;The pupil will then be marked present if they return to school within that session. &nbsp;Where a lengthy absence is involved (e.g. hospital treatment), please contact the Head of Year to ask for appropriate work to be set as soon as the pupil is well enough. &nbsp;In certain cases it is possible for home tuition to be arranged.</p>

<p>If pupils need to leave school during the course of the normal school day, they are required to collect a permission slip from their Head of Year. &nbsp;A truancy collection system is operated by GM Police and pupils without authorisation could be detained.</p>

<p>Law now requires schools to record all absences. &nbsp;Any period of absence not supported by a letter will be considered unauthorised (i.e. truancy). &nbsp;Truancy is dealt with seriously. &nbsp;The Education Welfare Officer can call on the home to assess the problem and/or issue a warning. &nbsp;Parents/carers may be asked to appear before a committee to explain the reason for the truancy, a penalty notice may be issued or, in extreme cases, a fine or a court summons may be issued.</p>

<p>We would also like to remind parents/carers that the law with respect to family holidays during term time has changed. &nbsp;Family holidays will, therefore, not be routinely authorised. &nbsp;All holidays taken during term time have to be recorded as an absence and will affect your child's overall attendance record.</p>

<p><strong>In summary:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Unless there are exceptional circumstances in the Headteacher's judgement, family holidays in term time will not be authorised.</li>
	<li>There is no entitlement for pupils to be absent on family holidays during term time.</li>
	<li>Unauthorised absences (including unauthorised absence due to family holidays) can incur fines such as Penalty Notices or other action.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Punctuality</h2>

<p>We feel that punctuality is essential for three reasons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>No pupil can afford to miss any part of lessons, as this does not help their understanding of a subject.</li>
	<li>A pupil entering lessons late could disrupt the learning of others.</li>
	<li>Punctuality records are always requested on references.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pupils arriving at school after the <strong>8:40am</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>bell will be kept until Period 1. &nbsp;In addition, they will also attend a fifteen minute detention at break time on the same day. &nbsp;Failure to attend this detention will result in a half-hour after school detention. &nbsp;Pupils arriving after <strong>9:00am</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>must sign in at Pupil Reception. &nbsp;In addition, they will attend a one-hour after school detention. &nbsp;A pupil arriving late to school on two occasions in a week will also attend a one-hour after school detention. &nbsp;All late after school detentions are held on a Friday. &nbsp;A letter for these detentions is given to the pupil, notifying parents/carers before it takes place. &nbsp;Persistent lateness may lead to further more serious sanctions.</p>

<h2>Pupils Leaving During the Day</h2>

<p>Under no circumstances may a pupil leave the school without the permission of a senior member of staff such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mr D Randle, Mr S White, Mr M Kojder, Mr M Morrell, Mrs J Brown, or the appropriate Head of Year.</li>
</ul>

<p>In every case the pupil must <strong>'sign out'</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>in the special book provided at Pupil Reception and hand in a note from the member of staff who has given permission. &nbsp;When they return to school they need to <strong>'sign in'</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>at the Pupil Reception so that the pupils who are present in the school can be accounted for in an emergency.</p>
