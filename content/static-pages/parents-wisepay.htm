<h2>Who Are WisePay?</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.wisepay.co.uk/schools/greatermanchester/HollingworthBusinessandEnterpriseCollege/wisepay.htm" rel="external">WisePay</a> is a secure online payment service that allows parents and carers (and extended family members), to make payments to their school using their debit or credit cards. Payments can include meals, trips, tickets, uniform purchases, book purchases, clubs, bus payments, sports or music payments - in fact, WisePay can facilitate any payments that may be made to a school.</p>

<p>The WisePay service operates in hundreds of schools, local authorities, academies and colleges across the UK. Our company has been in business for over 20 years.</p>

<h2>What Are the Advantages of Using WisePay</h2>

<p>Using your debit or credit card, payments to your school can be made conveniently from home, office, or anywhere that has an internet connection.</p>

<p>Payments can be made 24/7. You do not have to wait until your school is open and you do not have to write cheques or find cash. Furthermore, at any time you can see your payment history in your<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Wise Account</em>. Additionally, you can track every transaction that you make – again 24/7.</p>

<p>Your Wise Account also allows you to see your balances at anytime. This is particularly useful for a school trip that you are paying in instalments or for school meal balances. You no longer have to call your school to ask about your balance or wait for a statement to arrive – you can see this information anytime at your convenience.</p>

<h2>What Happens to My Money?</h2>

<p>All money that you pay goes directly and immediately to your schools bank account. WisePay does not take or hold any of your money at all.</p>

<p>In some instances, if your school has chosen to contract its school meal service to a third party (i.e. a catering contractor or the local authority), your payments will go directly to them. Again, none of your money goes to, or is held by, WisePay at anytime.</p>

<h2>Is WisePay Easy to Use?</h2>

<p>WisePay is extremely easy to use. It's visual and simple instructions are very quick and easy to follow, even for anyone who has never made an online payment or purchase before.</p>

<h2>How Long Do the Payments Take to Reach My School?</h2>

<p>All online payments are made in real time, so the payment will be credited to your account instantly.</p>

<h2>What Credit or Debit Cards Can I Use?</h2>

<p>Payments to your school through WisePay can be made with all well known credit or debit cards. All cards that you would use in any high street stores can be used.</p>

<h2>Is My Payment and the Payment Site Secure?</h2>

<p>Yes. All pages viewed on WisePay are encrypted using a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) session.</p>

<h2>Who Can See My Card Details?</h2>

<p>Neither WisePay nor your school can see or has access to any of your card details. Your card details are never stored by WisePay.</p>

<h2>How Does My School Know I Have Paid?</h2>

<p>The finance personnel within your school are notified that you have made a payment. They know which pupil the payment is for, how much has been paid and the item(s) that you have paid for.</p>

<h2>Will I Get a Reciept for My Payment?</h2>

<p>Yes, you will automatically receive a receipt directly to your email address for every payment that you make.</p>

<h2>How Do I View My Transactions?</h2>

<p>Once logged in to your account, you can access your <em>Wise Account</em>. Just click on the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Wise Account</em> tab on the top right of the screen.</p>

<p>From here you can see all your transaction history, view meal account balances (if relevant) and change some of your account details, such as email address or telephone number. You can also change your password from here.</p>

<h2>What Happens When Your Child Leaves Hollingworth?</h2>

<p>When your child leaves Hollingworth their Wisepay account becomes inactive and archived with their other school information. No bank details are kept on file.</p>

<p>If you child has any funds remaining on their account when they leave the balance will be transferred to any siblings in school or if your child does not have a sibling in school then the funds will be refunded through WisePay.</p>

<p>If you have any further questions about WisePay please contact the school on 01706 292800 or visit the WisePay website.</p>
