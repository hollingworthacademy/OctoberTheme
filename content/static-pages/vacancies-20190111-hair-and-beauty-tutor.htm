<p>We opened our Hair and Beauty salon in 2017; we offer Hair and Beauty as a key stage 4 option to some of our more practical learners. &nbsp;As we move toward September 2019, we have plans to expand this department and give more of our pupils the opportunity to engage in Hair and Beauty.</p>

<p>Hollingworth Academy is seeking to appoint a second Hair and Beauty Tutor with previous hairdressing and /or beauty experience to join our growing vocational department.</p>

<p>The successful candidate will work closely with the existing Hair and Beauty Tutor who has responsibility for the day-to-day running of the Hair &amp; Beauty salon and has already created schemes of work which will support you in delivering our Hair and Beauty qualifications. &nbsp;Currently we follow the VTCT Level 2 Certificate in hairdressing and Beauty Therapy.</p>

<p>There may be the opportunity for the successful candidate to rent / hire / use the salon facilities for either their own Hair &amp; Beauty related business, or a shared enterprise with the academy. This could be discussed at interview.</p>

<p>The successful applicant will be an excellent practitioner who is committed to meeting the needs of all pupils by ensuring that lessons are of the highest quality and are innovative, engaging and enjoyable.</p>
