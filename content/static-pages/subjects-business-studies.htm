<h2>The Curriculum</h2>

<h3>Key Stage 3</h3>

<p>Business Studies is a 1 hour lesson as part of our preference curriculum in Year 9.</p>

<h3>Key Stage 4</h3>

<p>Pupils in Years 10 &amp; 11 receive three 60 minute lessons a week with homework set once a week. The two year GCSE course is externally examined with the Edexcel examination board, (75% examinations and 25% Controlled Assessment). Pupils are taught in mixed ability groups. Progress is tracked and monitored in accordance with agreed procedure. Pupils complete a range of both formal and informal assessments in the form of extended writing activities in class, as well as mock and real examinations.</p>

<p>For upper school, the Business department organises support sessions over several hours in a week, whereby intensive revision programmes, assessment guidance and mentoring support is offered. All year groups can access the computers and internet facilities which are always available for pupils to use.</p>
