<p>We are looking to increase our bank of Examination Invigilators, to help supervise and ensure efficient running of the School’s examinations. Invigilators will be required to work during examination periods, which run at various times throughout the year, with busier periods during November, December, March, May and June. Successful candidates will be employed on a casual, ad-hoc basis, with particularly heavy periods being in May and June each year.</p>
