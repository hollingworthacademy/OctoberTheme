<h2>Uniform Sales</h2>

<p>Following the consultation period with parents it has been agreed by governors that uniform can continue to be supplied by local suppliers. We have received confirmation from Ziggys School Wear, Moses and TopForm that they wish to supply Hollingworth Academy uniform to parents in line with the school requirements.</p>

<p>To hopefully meet all parental demands and offer a competitive price for the new blazer we have secured pricing from the manufacturers directly on all uniform and these will be available on <a href="https://www.wisepay.co.uk/schools/greatermanchester/HollingworthBusinessandEnterpriseCollege/wisepay.htm" rel="external">WisePay</a><span>&nbsp;</span>for current parents to purchase.</p>

<p>The new Year 7 parents will receive log in details for WisePay when they attend the Induction Evening on Tuesday 3rd July 2018.</p>

<p><strong>The deadline for ordering uniform through Wisepay is 15th July 2018.</strong> Any orders placed after this date may not arrive in time for the new school term.</p>

<p>With the exception of upper and lower school ties,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>uniform is not stocked in school</strong> and is ordered direct from the manufacturer of which the school has no control of stock and lead times. Therefore, please note that any items purchased through WisePay will not be available for collection from the school until approximately<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>4 weeks after ordering</strong>.</p>

<p>At Hollingworth Academy we believe that school uniform is important in ensuring that children, whatever their background or circumstances, feel an equal part of the school community. We also believe that a smart, well presented uniform indicates a willingness to comply with school rules and is good preparation for learning.</p>

<p>The governors fully support the School Uniform Policy and require the Headteacher or his representative to be the final arbiter in all matters to do with uniform, dress and appearance. Parents/Carers and pupils are advised to consult with relevant Heads of Year if they are considering uniform, dress or appearance changes that might conflict with school policy.</p>

<p>Makeup must not be used by pupils in Years 7, 8 or 9. In Years 10 and 11, makeup must be subtle. The definition of 'subtle' lies with the Headteacher. Nails must be kept hygenic, safe length and not have nail polish on or acrylic nail extensions. This is for health and safety reasons.</p>

<p><strong>The Headteacher or his representative will be the final arbiter on all uniform issues.</strong></p>
