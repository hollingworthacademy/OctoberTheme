<h1>What is Careers Education, Information, Advice and Guidance (CEIAG)?</h1>

<p>Careers Education, Information, Advice and Guidance programmes make a major contribution in preparing young people for opportunities, responsibilities and experience of life. They help young people make decisions and manage transitions as learners and workers. It is vital that all 11-16 year olds have the knowledge and skills they need to make informed choices. We strive at all times to conform to the current "best practices" in Careers Education, Information, Advice and Guidance laid down by the government.</p>

<p>Hollingworth Academy is committed to providing a planned programme of CEIAG for all students in Years 7-11, in partnership with outside agencies (Colleges, 6th Forms, Apprenticeship providers, Positive Steps and Universities). Hollingworth Academy has a strong track record of success with its CEIAG programme, as demonstrated by its consistently outstanding 'destination' data, which we are required to monitor as part of our CEIAG policy. The most recent figures for this are as follows:</p>
